# Deepdive in to MLOps Lifecycle 

Machine Learning (ML) has become a revolutionary technology that is pushing the limits in many areas, especially in Finance, E-Commerce and Healthcare. The ML models are rapidly developed and dynamic nature requires a well planned deployment of the models. Unless the deployment is not well thought will go for a disaster. Hence it is important to understand how it is deployed and what are the considerations. 

**MLOps** which is based on the DevOps movement that revolutionised software development and seamless deployment to the world with least downtime and high-availability manner. MLOps seeks to bridge the gap between development and operations in the field of AI/ML such as automated deployment, reproduction and collabaration between ML Application stake holders in systematic way.

Let us delve in to MLOps cycle and get in to important aspects of ML system design.

MLOps is the bridging point of Machine Learning and Operations with aim of seamless integration of ML Model development and operations. The key aspects are following

- Reproducibility 
Ensuring the ML deployment produces consistent outcomes across different environments.

- Automation
Automation helps reducing the time taken , eliminates the manual interventions and errors.
Automate stages possible from data collection , pre-processing , model training , evalution and deployment.

- Collaboration
Collaboration is much needed for successful deployment of ML. Data Scientists, ML engineers and Operation Teams to come together to develop and deployement.

- Monitoring 
Dynamic nature of ML, where the data patterns continue to change which affects the model predictions which needs continious monitoring of ML deployments. MLOps to make sure real-time observations, anamolies and trigger re-training with latest data etc will be crucial. 

- Governance
ML Model deployment requires guidelines for development, deployment and later changes to accommodate to keep every stake holder on same page for Successful ML Deployment. 

**Why MLOps is the key?**
Due to rapid advancement of ML made a paradigm shift. ML involves handling dynamic nature of data, Model training/re-training , complex deployment and Scalability. MLOps plays vital role in covering all these aspects.

MLOps also ensures to rollback to previous deployment in the case of model predictablity is not doing well with dynamic data change.

One important aspect of MLOps is, Time to Market, this is crucial for successful ML Application deployment to foray in to market. MLOps significantly reduces the time to market with seamless  automation, collabrating with different stake holders and deployment of change with ease of automation.

MLOps also ensures the Security aspects of data breaching, privacy , regulatory and compliance of data/model being deployed in public.

**In Summary**, MLOps is not just a best practices, its proven strategy to ensure ML deployment is successful, scalable and sistainable for long.
